# credit-risk-classification

- In this project I trained and evaluated a model based on loan risk. I used a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that identified the creditworthiness of borrowers.

- Precision measures the accuracy of the positive predictions, in this case a precision for class 1 is 84% meaning that 84% os the predicted positives were actually positive.
- The recall percentages are much higher, with a 99% for class 0 meaning that it correctly identified 99% of the actual negatives. It gave us a 94% for class 1, meaning that 94% of the actual positives were correctly identified.
- The F1 Score is the mean of the precision and recall, for this model the score for class 0 was 1 and for class 1 it was .89. Both are high scores meaning there is a good balance between preciison and recall in this model.

- Given the F1 Scores for both classes in this model, I would suggest the company use this model to make predictions and to help identifiy creditworthiness of borrowers. A 94% and a 100% F1 score indicate high levels of accuracy in this model.
